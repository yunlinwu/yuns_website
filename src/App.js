        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Yun. As a senior Computer Science student at Columbia University, I've honed my skills with Python, Java, Docker, and AWS, and have a knack for building robust APIs with FastAPI. My passion for problem-solving has been sharpened through my internship at Fannie Mae, where I tackled technical challenges head-on to develop efficient, effective software solutions.
        <p>
        My analytical, communication, and problem-solving skills don't just make me technically proficient â€“ they make me a reliable team player. My leadership role at the Application Development Initiative, leading a team on open-source projects, is a testament to this.        </p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>
        Beyond coding, my diverse hobbies, including yoga, reading, juggling, and throwing frisbee have honed my sense of balance and creativity. My practice of mindfulness, cultivated through leading the Columbia Bhagavad Gita Association, fosters a focused mindset that I bring to my projects. Ever eager to learn and grow, I approach every new coding challenge with a blend of enthusiasm, calm, and determination.
